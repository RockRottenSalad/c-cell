The expr production is equivalent to the start_recurive_descent() function.
Otherwise, every other production name matches the function name.

expr -> term
term -> factor (( "-" | "+" ) factor)*
factor -> unary (("/" | "*") unary)*
unary -> "-" unary | primary
primary -> LITERAL | IDENTIFIER ("(" expr ")")?  | "(" expr ")"

IDENTIFIER followed by parantheses makes a function.
Without parentheses, it turns into a reference to another expression.
